## Overview
The HMS database is meticulously designed to cater to the dynamic and multifaceted nature of hospital management. It includes tables for patients, staff, departments, doctors, nurses, emergency contacts, payroll, lab screenings, insurance, medicine, prescriptions, medical history, appointments, rooms, billing, visits, attendants, and feedback. Each table is interconnected through well-defined relationships, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

The database is built using MySQL and adheres to best practices in database design, including normalization, appropriate indexing, and foreign key constraints. The use of colors in the Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram aids in the visual representation and categorization of tables, facilitating easier understanding and navigation.
